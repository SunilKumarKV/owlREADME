## 🚀 v0.5.0 — Workspace Suite & Security
**Released: 2026-06-26**

This release transforms OwlREADME from a single-page tool into a full developer workspace platform.

### Highlights
- **🔐 Secure AI Proxy** — Gemini API keys are now protected server-side via a Next.js App Router API route, eliminating any client-side credential exposure.
- **🗂️ Multi-Workspace Hub** — Create, rename, duplicate, delete, and auto-restore multiple named project workspaces persisted to local storage with 500ms debounce auto-saving.
- **📊 SVG Analytics Console** — Visual language distribution donut, export frequency bar chart, and weekday activity area chart — all built with vanilla SVG, zero external charting dependencies.
- **🤖 Owl AI Assistant** — Dashboard panel offering three assistant modes: README writer, Roadmap advisor, and Profile improver. Powered by Gemini with a smart offline fallback.
- **🔍 GitHub Repository Analyzer** — Automatically scans public repos to compute language frequencies, top starred/active repositories, and tech stack suggestions.
- **🌐 Public Share Pages** — Generate encoded share URLs for both README profiles (`/share/readme`) and Learning Roadmaps (`/share/roadmap`) with theme support.
- **📦 Export Studio Overhaul** — Multi-file ZIP packaging, styled PDF printing, copy-to-clipboard, and an export session history log.
- **🎨 SaaS Product Landing Page** — Full hero section, feature grid, interactive template tabs, testimonials, a How-It-Works timeline, and FAQ accordion.
- **♿ W3C Accessibility (a11y)** — ARIA tablist roles, properly coupled `<label>` + `id` bindings, and arrow-key-navigable radio groups.
- **🛡️ Production DevOps** — `vercel.json` security headers, Open Graph image, analytics integration hooks, and `robots.txt`/`sitemap.xml`.

### Upgrade Notes
This release is backwards compatible with v0.1.0 local storage data. On first load, legacy data is automatically migrated into a "Default Workspace".
